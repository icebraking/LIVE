    <h1>Aston Martin</h1>
    <p>
      Aston Martin's Formula 1 history is episodic, commencing in 1959 with the DBR4/300 chassis at the Dutch Grand Prix, though the British marque scored no points before withdrawing in 1960 due to escalating costs. The modern iteration emerged in 2021 via a rebranding of Racing Point, itself evolved from Force India (2008–2018) and Jordan (1991–2005). Lawrence Stroll's 2020 consortium investment elevated the team, securing fifth in Constructors' that year. With the assistance of Mercedes PU, Aston Martin have been a constant presence in the F1 midfield. However they are aiming for gold in 2026 when the new regulations kicks in with Honda power. In the annals of Formula 1, few unions have ignited such fervent anticipation as the alliance forged between Aston Martin and Adrian Newey a convergence that elevates the British marque's storied legacy into an era of unparalleled aerodynamic alchemy, announced on September 10, 2024, and consummated with Newey's formal induction as Managing Technical Partner on March 1, 2025. The one word that describes Aston Martin would be 'Ambitious'!
